# deployed-discord-bot-basic
This is a working version of a Discord bot. Only hidden code is bot token/key because it's mine, and the rest is there 
i can not call all of this code mine i did follow a tutorial but as i add more to things more and more will be my cod e

the .env file that I left out is part of a token thing that if i share my code any one can use that bot for whatever they want and i dont need that
so simple problem, simple sloution dont add it and explain how to add your own file of that type that is needed for the bot to  run 

you will need a .env file, a discord bot token ( long string of random characters that makes sense to the computers)

in the .env file add DISCORD_TOKEN = (your token here) 

if you need better help follow this youtube video, its the one I used for the start of the code around the first 100 lines
